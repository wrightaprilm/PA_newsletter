## Recap

In the previous installment of this newsletter, we covered using the Mk model of Paul Lewis [@Lewis2001] to estimate a phylogenetic tree. Today, we will be examining how to relax some of the assumptions of the Mk model, particularly the assumption of equal state frequencies, and by extension, equal between-state transition rates.

### Relaxing Character State Symmetry

The Mk model makes a number of assumptions, but one that may strike you
as particularly unrealistic is the assumption that characters are equally likely to change from any one state to any other. That means that a trait is as likely to be gained as lost. While this may hold true for some
traits, we expect that it may be untrue for many others.

RevBayes has functionality to allow us to relax this assumption. We do
this by specifying a beta prior on state frequencies. Stationary frequencies impact how likely we are to see changes in a character. For example, it may be very likely, in a character, to change from 0 to 1. But if the frequency of 0 is very low, we will still seldom see this change.

We can think of a Q matrix as looking like so:


$$Q = \begin{pmatrix} -\mu_0\pi0 & \mu_{01}\pi0 \\
\mu_{10}\pi1 & -\mu_1\pi1  &\\
\end{pmatrix} \mbox{  ,}$$


In which the probability of changing states depends not solely on the transition probability, but also the frequency of the starting state. For example, if we have a rare character state, we do not expect to see many transitions from the rare state to another. $\pi$ is the value chosen to represent state frequency commonly in phylogenetic models.

We can exploit the relationship between state frequencies and observed
changes to allow for variable Q-matrices across characters. To do this, we generate a beta distribution on state frequencies, and use the state frequencies from that distribution to generate a series of Q-matrices used to evaluate our data [@Pagel2004, @Nylander2004, @Wright2016].

This type of model is called a **mixture model**. There are assumed to
be subdivisions in the data, which may require different parameters (in
this case, state frequencies). These subdivisions are not defined *a
priori*. This model has previously been shown to be effective for a
range of empirical and simulated datasets [Wright2016].

## Modifying the Rev-script

>Make a copy of the Rev script you made in the previous tutorial. Call it
>`mcmc_mk_discretized.Rev`. This new script will
>contain the new model parameters and models.


We will use the copy of the Mk model script from last newsletter's tutorial. We will
not need to modify the helper variables or MCMC setup. 

We will use a discretized beta distribution to place a prior on the state frequencies. 
The beta distribution has two parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. These two
parameters specify the shape of the distribution. State frequencies will
be evaluated according to this distribution, in the same way that rate
variation is evaluated according to the gamma distribution. The
discretized distribution is split into multiple classes, each with it's
own set of frequencies for the 0 and 1 characters. The number of classes
can vary; we have chosen 4 for tractability. Note that we need to make sure that this discretization results in a symmetric model, therefore we will use only one parameter for the beta distribution: `beta_scale` such that $\alpha = \beta$.
```{r, include=TRUE, eval=F}
num_cats = 4
beta_scale ~ dnLognormal( 0.0, sd=2*0.587405 )
moves.append( mvScale(beta_scale, lambda=1, weight=5.0 ) )
```
Above, we initialized the number of categories, the parameters of the
beta distribution, and the moves on these parameters. This can be added before teh definition of the Q matrix.

Next, we set the categories to each represent a quadrant of the beta
distribution specified by `beta_scale`. 
```{r, include=TRUE, eval=F}
cats := fnDiscretizeBeta(beta_scale, beta_scale, num_cats)
```
If you were to print the `cats` variable, you would see a list of state
frequencies like so:

```
[ 0.011, 0.236, 0.764, 0.989 ]
```

Using these state frequencies, we will generate a new vector of Q-matrices. Because we are varying the state frequencies, we must use a Q-matrix generation function that allows for state frequencies to vary as
a parameter. We will, therefore, use the `fnF81` function. This code block will replace the old Q matrix.
```{r, include=TRUE, eval=F}
for (i in 1:cats.size())
{
    Q[i] := fnF81(simplex(abs(1-cats[i]), cats[i]))
}
```
Additionally, in RevBayes we need to specify the probabilities that a site evolves according to one
of the Q-matrices. For this model the probabilities must be equal because we need to guarantee that
the model is symmetric. Thus, we use a `simplex` function to create a vector that sums to 1.0.
```{r, include=TRUE, eval=F}
matrix_probs <- simplex( rep(1,num_cats) )
```

This will be added to the CTMC like so:


```
phyMorpho ~ dnPhyloCTMC(tree=phylogeny, siteRates=rates_morpho, Q=Q, siteMatrices=matrix_probs, type="Standard", coding="variable")
```

In the above, we have modified the CTMC to accept a vector of Q-matrices, instead of one. 

This script can now be executed as in Lesson Two.
